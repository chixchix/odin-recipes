        <p><h3>Steps</h3></P>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully examine your cauliflower for any moldy parts and remove them by scraping it off with a slice on the surface. Repeat this process until no mold is seen on the surface.</li>
            <li>Place your cauliflower in a bowl of warm water and salt mixture for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rinse your cauliflower by pouring water on it to get rid of the salt water mixure.</li>
            <li>Cut your cauliflower into two parts and grate each parts in a big bowl carefully.</li>
            <li>Place your chicken in a bowl and  wear gloves during this process.</li>
            <li>Carefully put spices, black peper, salt, coriander, garlic powder, knorr seasoning cubes,garlic cloves, and more seasoning of choice.</li>
            <li>Stir the chicken until the spices evenly mix and spray some oil in the mix.</li>
            <li>Set your air fryer to the chicken setting instruction, mine is 375 F for 35 minutes. Turn during the half way mark to even out both sides. Continue to spray oil on chicken if it gets dry quickly while frying for better texture.</li>
            <li>Put your grated cauliflower in a pan with no oil on low heat.</li>
            <li>Allow cauliflower to sit in low heat until its dry enough for you then add your salt, black peper, tumeric, or other seasonings of choice. Stir until its all mixed in.
                Allow it to sit for 7 more minutes then set aside and add your parsely.
            </li>
            <li>Once chicken is done serve with your cauliflower rice and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
